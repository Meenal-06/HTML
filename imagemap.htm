<h1><center> Image Map</center></h1>
The HTML <map> tag defines an image map. An image map is an image with clickable areas. 
<hThe areas are defined with one or more <area> tags.
<h1><center> Types of image map</center></h1>
There are two types of image maps<br> 1. server side <br> 2. client side.
<h2> server  side</h2>
The is map attribute is a boolean attribute.
 When present, it specifies that the image is part of a server-side image map.
<h2> client side</h2>
 Client-side imagemaps are clickable images that don't require a CGI program to make them work. ... 
Because they are faster and more reliable, client-side imagemaps have largely supplanted server-side imagemaps
